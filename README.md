# What's this?

A computer model for the flocking behaviour of birds, basically. It was
[developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/).

This particular implementation uses [P5](http://p5js.org/), an accessible
JavaScript computer graphics library. The P5 website also contains [a slightly
different implementation of the same flocking model](http://p5js.org/examples/hello-p5-flocking.html).


# Installation

Download the minified p5 source from http://p5js.org/download/ and place it in
the same folder with the rest of the code.

Open the file `index.html` in your favourite browser, (enable JavaScript if not
already enabled), and admire the birds until you first start feeling drowsy and finally fall asleep on your keyboard. ðŸ˜´
